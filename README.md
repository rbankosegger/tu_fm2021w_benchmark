# Benchmarking-Projekt

In this group project, three simple pathfinding-algorithms were benchmarked.
Performance was measured using three criteria (runtime, allocated memory and algorithm output)
and in three graph classes (Klique with random weights, grid with random weights, grandomly generated maze).
